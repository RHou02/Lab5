# Week 5 Contribution (Individual)

## Project Title:LexGuard——Neuro-Symbolic Compliance Auditor

### Member: Ruixuan Hou

## Responsibilities 

In this project, my primary responsibility was to set up and test the connection between our Snowflake account and the local Python environment. I tested how the Snowflake credentials (user, password, account, warehouse, role) were correctly connected to the ingestion script.

I also worked on SQL-related tasks. This included reviewing and executing SQL statements for user creation, role assignment, warehouse usage, schema privileges, and validating that the PUBLIC role had correct access. I tested queries to ensure that the database structure and permissions were functioning properly.

In addition, I validated the overall pipeline workflow to ensure that data ingestion and database interaction worked as expected.
